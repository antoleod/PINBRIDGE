## Mobile improvements

- Added a mobile hamburger menu to toggle the sidebar: click the ☰ button in the top-left of the mobile top bar.
- Sidebar now slides in as an overlay on small screens and a backdrop closes it when tapped.

Quick test (open `index.html` in a mobile emulator or narrow your browser):

```sh
# Open `index.html` in browser and toggle responsive mode (DevTools -> Toggle device toolbar)
```

If you want, I can add an animated close button, or move the backdrop element into the HTML markup instead of creating it dynamically.
