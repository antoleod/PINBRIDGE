## Global Learning Model
Unified across languages and certs.

### Level 1: Recognition
- Identify terms, concepts.
- Current quiz MCQs.

### Level 2: Understanding
- Explain meanings.
- Add explanations in current system.

### Level 3: Application
- Use in new contexts.
- Add ambiguous scenarios: "In this work email, what would you say?"

### Level 4: Transfer
- Apply to different scenarios.
- Transfer tasks: "Same idea, different context" (e.g., vocab in business vs. personal).

### Level 5: Judgment
- Choose best among bad options.
- Questions with distractors that are almost correct, forcing critical thinking.

## Difficulty Engine
- **Metrics:** Success rate, time taken, repeated attempts.
- **Adaptation:**
  - Success streak >3: Increase ambiguity (more distractors, subtle differences).
  - Hesitation >10s: Introduce analogies or simplified cases.
  - Failure >2: Switch representation (text to diagram).
- **Representation Changes:** Text, audio (TTS), visual (diagrams).

## Mastery Path
- Daily: Concept + Scenario + Decision + Explanation + Transfer + Reflection.
- Weekly: Escalate ambiguity.
- Route: 30+ days, ending with exams/remediation.

## Scenarios & Decisions
- **Ambiguous:** Real-life with multiple plausible answers.
- **Good Distractors:** Common mistakes, near-correct options.
- **Explanations:** Why correct, why others fail (with reasoning).

## Transfer Tasks
- Variant of concept in new context.
- User applies knowledge actively.

## Micro-Reflections
- 1-3 lines: "What surprised you?" or "How would you use this?"

This pushes beyond memorization to decision-making and mastery.</content>
